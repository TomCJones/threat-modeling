### **Threat Model for W3C Protocol for Digital Credentials**  

Digital credentials are essential for secure identity verification online. The **W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM)** provides a framework for issuing, storing, and verifying credentials. Below is a structured threat model for this protocol.

---

## **1. Identify Key Components & Actors**  
The W3C protocol for digital credentials involves three main actors:  
- **Issuer** – Issues verifiable credentials (VCs).  
- **Holder** – Stores and presents credentials.  
- **Verifier** – Validates credentials.  

### **Data Flows:**  
1. **Issuer creates & signs credentials** → Holder stores credentials.  
2. **Holder presents credentials** → Verifier checks authenticity.  
3. **Verifier queries credential status** → Issuer confirms validity.  

---

## **2. Identify Potential Threats Using STRIDE**  
Threats vary across credential lifecycle stages. Here's a structured analysis:  

| **Threat** | **Protocol Concern** | **Example** |
|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Spoofing** | Fake credential issuance | Malicious entity impersonates an issuer |
| **Tampering** | Unauthorized credential modification | Holder alters credential data before presenting |
| **Repudiation** | Denying credential usage | Holder claims they never presented a credential |
| **Information Disclosure** | Unintended data exposure | Verifier leaks credential details to third parties |
| **Denial of Service** | Blocking credential verification | DDoS attack on verification endpoints |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Unauthorized access | Compromised verifier gains issuer privileges |

### **Recommended Approach:**  
- **Assess attack surfaces** per credential lifecycle stage.  
- **Map adversary techniques** using MITRE ATT&CK.  

### **Tools:**  
- OWASP Amass (Reconnaissance)  
- Burp Suite (Intercepting Credential Flows)  
- OpenSSL (Cryptographic Testing)

## **3. Define Mitigation Strategies**  
To protect digital credentials:  
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Ensure issuers use **DID-based authentication**.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP):** Allow holders to prove claims **without revealing full credentials**.  
- **Secure Storage:** Use **hardware security modules (HSMs)** for credential storage.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification:** Implement **Selective Disclosure** to limit data exposure.  
- **Rate Limiting & Firewall Rules:** Prevent **credential verification abuse**.  

### **Tools:**  
- OWASP Dependency Check (Library Vulnerabilities)  
- SIEM (Splunk, Elastic Security)  
- Web Application Firewalls (ModSecurity, AWS WAF)  

---

## **4. Validate & Iterate the Model**  
Regular updates ensure evolving threats are mitigated.  
- Conduct **pen tests targeting credential issuance, storage, and verification**.  
- Perform **packet analysis** to detect protocol misuse.  
- Maintain **incident response plans** for credential-based attacks.  

### **Recommended Practices:**  
✔ Apply **Zero Trust principles** across credential verification.  
✔ Implement **certificate pinning** to prevent MITM attacks.  
✔ Use **HSTS headers** to force HTTPS adoption.
