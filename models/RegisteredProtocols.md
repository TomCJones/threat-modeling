Registration protocols in the browser—such as those used to register **media types, custom protocols, or credential handlers**—serve a foundational purpose: enabling websites or installed web applications to **interact securely and predictably with browser features** or external systems.

Here’s what they’re designed to do:

---

### 🛂 **1. Declare Capability**
Web apps can register that they’re able to handle certain types of content or actions, like:
- Media codecs (e.g. H.264, AV1)
- File types (e.g. `.pdf`, `.webm`)
- Protocols (e.g. `mailto:`, `web+custom:`)
- Credential formats (e.g. verifiable credentials via `navigator.credentials`)

This lets the browser know **what to do when encountering specific data or links.**

---

### 🔐 **2. Enforce Trust Boundaries**
Only **registered, user-approved applications** can respond to certain actions—like a digital wallet being asked to present credentials or a PWA (Progressive Web App) receiving a shared file. This prevents rogue sites from impersonating trusted apps.

---

### 🧩 **3. Enable Extensibility and Modularity**
By allowing apps to register for specific formats or tasks, browsers support a **plug-in–like model**—without compromising sandboxing or security. For example:
- A media player registers to handle new video codecs via `MediaSource.isTypeSupported()`
- A wallet registers via the Credential Handler API to provide cryptographic proofs

---

### 🧭 **4. Align with User Intent**
With registration, a **user’s choice gets honored**, rather than hardcoded defaults. This is especially important for identity, credential sharing, or default app behaviors on mobile browsers.

---

### 🧠 **Why It Matters for Privacy and Control**
If misused, registration protocols could open the door to **metadata leaks or surveillance**. That’s why groups like the W3C and browser vendors add:
- **Permission prompts**
- **User mediation requirements**
- **Origin-based security models**

If you’d like, we can explore how registration protocols play into credential wallets, DID-based identity systems, or how browsers differ (e.g. Chrome’s vs. Safari’s approach). Want to dive deeper?


Credential Handlers are browser-based components that allow websites or applications to **interact with digital wallets or identity providers** using a consistent, privacy-aware interface. They play a central role in ecosystems involving **Verifiable Credentials**, **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**, and **self-sovereign identity (SSI)** models.

### 🧩 What is a Credential Handler?

It’s a **JavaScript-based service**—usually implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or WebExtension—that registers itself with the browser to **handle credential-related tasks**, such as:

- Responding to requests for **presentation of credentials** (e.g. “Prove your age”)
- Facilitating **credential issuance** (e.g. storing a university diploma in a wallet)
- Managing **user consent and disclosure** before sharing data

The Credential Handler is registered using the `navigator.credentials` API and supports protocols like **WebCredential Handler API**, **OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)**, or **CHAPI** (Credential Handler API from the Decentralized Identity Foundation).

---

### 🔒 Why They Matter

Credential Handlers:

- **Give users control**: They sit between websites (relying parties) and wallets (credential stores), ensuring users approve each interaction.
- **Enable privacy-preserving data exchange**: They support selective disclosure (sharing only necessary attributes).
- **Support ecosystem interoperability**: Handlers abstract the wallet logic, allowing different issuers/verifiers to plug into the ecosystem without needing custom integration.

### 🛠️ Real-World Example

Say a job portal wants to verify a digital degree certificate. The flow might look like this:
1. The portal requests a credential via browser.
2. The Credential Handler intercepts the request.
3. It prompts the user to select a credential from their wallet.
4. With user consent, it sends a verifiable presentation back to the portal.

Credential Handlers help create a secure, user-centric web where people can **prove who they are—without leaking everything about themselves**. Want to explore how this fits into larger architectures like eIDAS 2.0, ISO 18013-7, or mobile driver’s licenses? I can map that out for you.
