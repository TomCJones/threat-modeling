Credential Handlers are browser-based components that allow websites or applications to **interact with digital wallets or identity providers** using a consistent, privacy-aware interface. They play a central role in ecosystems involving **Verifiable Credentials**, **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**, and **self-sovereign identity (SSI)** models.

### 🧩 What is a Credential Handler?

It’s a **JavaScript-based service**—usually implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or WebExtension—that registers itself with the browser to **handle credential-related tasks**, such as:

- Responding to requests for **presentation of credentials** (e.g. “Prove your age”)
- Facilitating **credential issuance** (e.g. storing a university diploma in a wallet)
- Managing **user consent and disclosure** before sharing data

The Credential Handler is registered using the `navigator.credentials` API and supports protocols like **WebCredential Handler API**, **OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)**, or **CHAPI** (Credential Handler API from the Decentralized Identity Foundation).

### 🔒 Why They Matter

Credential Handlers:

- **Give users control**: They sit between websites (relying parties) and wallets (credential stores), ensuring users approve each interaction.
- **Enable privacy-preserving data exchange**: They support selective disclosure (sharing only necessary attributes).
- **Support ecosystem interoperability**: Handlers abstract the wallet logic, allowing different issuers/verifiers to plug into the ecosystem without needing custom integration.

### 🛠️ Real-World Example

Say a job portal wants to verify a digital degree certificate. The flow might look like this:
1. The portal requests a credential via browser.
2. The Credential Handler intercepts the request.
3. It prompts the user to select a credential from their wallet.
4. With user consent, it sends a verifiable presentation back to the portal.

Credential Handlers help create a secure, user-centric web where people can **prove who they are—without leaking everything about themselves**. Want to explore how this fits into larger architectures like eIDAS 2.0, ISO 18013-7, or mobile driver’s licenses? I can map that out for you.
